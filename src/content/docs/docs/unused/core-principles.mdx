Fluxzero is designed to make communication within and between your apps reliable and effortless.
These principles guide everything in the platform:

- **Decoupled producers and consumers** — senders never depend on how or when messages are handled.
- **Uniform communication** — whether inside a single app or across apps, the messaging model is the same.
- **Transparent load distribution** — message load is automatically shared across apps.
- **Zero awareness between apps** — applications don’t need to know about each other to work together.
- **Built-in backpressure** — flow control is part of the core design, not an afterthought.
- **No entity locks required** — messages can be processed without blocking or manual synchronization.
- **Messages are never lost** — every message is durably logged. Handlers cannot skip messages accidentally.
- **Replayable at any time** — past messages can be replayed for recovery, migration, or analytics.
- **Auditable history** — every sent message is recorded for inspection and compliance.

These principles aren’t just design goals — they’re guarantees Fluxzero enforces in practice.
