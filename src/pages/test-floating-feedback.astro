    <h2>Sample Documentation Content</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Installation:</strong> To get started with Fluxzero, you need to install the SDK and configure your development environment. This involves setting up dependencies, configuring your project structure, and understanding the core concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Fluxzero SDK provides a comprehensive platform for building event-driven applications.
      With built-in support for commands, events, and queries, developers can focus on business logic
      rather than infrastructure concerns.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting Started Guide</h3>

    <p>
      Once you have the SDK installed, you'll need to configure your project structure, and understanding the core concepts
      becomes essential for effective development. The framework handles routing, serialization,
      and persistence automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      Key concepts include aggregates, commands, events, and projections. Each plays a crucial role
      in the event-sourcing architecture that Fluxzero provides out of the box.
    </p>

    <h3>Advanced Features</h3>

    <p>
      Fluxzero also includes advanced features like automatic scaling, monitoring, and observability.
      The platform can handle high-throughput scenarios with built-in backpressure and circuit breakers.

      <strong>Expected behavior:</strong><br>
      • Feedback indicators should appear next to text that matches the mock data selections<br>
      • Text should be highlighted with subtle background and dashed underline<br>
      • Clicking indicators shows popup with feedback details<br>
      • Indicators follow the text as you scroll<br>
      • Intersection observer makes highlights more prominent when in view
