Thanks for trusting Fluxzero with your projects and your data. Protecting your privacy is a responsibility we take seriously. This page explains what we collect, why we collect it, how long we keep it, where we process it, who sees it, and the choices you have — in plain language.

## 1) What we collect and why

We only collect personal data that we need to provide the service, keep it secure, and improve it. Below are the **categories**, **purposes**, and **legal bases** (GDPR Art. 6).

- *Why:* invoicing, tax/record-keeping
- *Legal basis:* **Legal obligation** (6(1)(c)) and **Contract** (6(1)(b))

### Product Usage & Diagnostics
- *What:* service logs (timestamps, IP, user/tenant IDs, API/resource IDs), device/browser info, event metadata

## 2) Cookies & similar technologies

- We use **essential cookies** to run the site (authentication, security, load balancing).
- We use **analytics** (e.g., Google Analytics) and **session replay** (e.g., Microsoft Clarity) **only after your consent**.
- You can change or withdraw consent anytime via **“Cookie settings”** in our footer.

See the full **Cookie Notice** below for details.

## 3) Who sees your data (recipients)

We share data only with trusted service providers under data processing agreements, and only for the purposes above. Typical categories:

- **Hosting & infrastructure** (cloud, CDN, email, logging)
- **Payments & billing** (payment processor, invoicing)
- **Analytics / session replay** (only if you consent)
- **Support tools** (ticketing, CRM)

We don’t sell personal data.

We maintain a current **Sub-processors** page listing vendors, purposes, locations, and transfer mechanisms (link this from your site).

## 4) International transfers

We primarily process and store data in the **EU/EEA** where possible. When we transfer personal data outside the EEA/UK, we use **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** and additional safeguards as needed. You can request a copy of the relevant transfer terms at [privacy@fluxzero.io](mailto:privacy@fluxzero.io).
