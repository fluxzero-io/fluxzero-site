</Steps>

## Manual Project Setup

If you prefer to set up a project manually, you can also:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Maven">
```bash
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DgroupId=com.example \
  -DartifactId=my-fluxzero-app \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=fluxzero-starter-archetype \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=io.fluxzero
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Gradle">
```bash
mkdir my-fluxzero-app
cd my-fluxzero-app
gradle init --type java-application
# Add Fluxzero dependencies to build.gradle
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- **Download doesn't start**: Check that you've filled in both the project name and selected a template
- **Build fails**: Ensure you have Java 17+ installed and configured
- **Port already in use**: Change the server port in `application.properties`
