## Why Flux Cloud?

Flux primary goal is to improve developer productivity. It does that by providing an SDK which allows you to focus on writing business logic.
However, writing the software is only half of the job. Deploying and monitoring it is the other half.
Flux Cloud is a fully managed service that takes care of the deployment and monitoring of your Flux projects.
