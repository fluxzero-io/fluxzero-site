Installation can be done in multiple ways. 
The recommended way is to use our CLI, but if you prefer not to install anything you can also use our project generator form to create a ready-to-go project.

## Use our project generator

In case you prefer not to install our CLI, you can generate a project using the form below. 
This will create a zip file with a ready-to-go Fluxzero project that you can download and run locally.

<ProjectGenerator />

## Using the Fluxzero CLI

To build Fluxzero projects, the only thing you need is Java 21+. However, we recommend using the **Fluxzero CLI** as it is the most convenient way to get started quickly. The CLI is a command line tool that helps you scaffold, build, and run Fluxzero applications.

<Steps>

1. Get the Fluxzero CLI

   <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Bash">
         ```shell
            curl -o- -s -L https://fluxzero.io/cli.sh | bash
         ```

         This script will perform the following actions
         - Check if you have Java 21+ installed
         - Download the latest Fluxzero CLI release 
         - Install the CLI in `~/.fluxzero/bin/fz`
         - (Optionally) Install Fluxzero command `fz` into `/usr/local/bin`
      </TabItem>

      {/* <TabItem label="Docker">
         If you prefer to use Docker, you can run the Fluxzero CLI in a container. This is useful if you don't want to install Java or the CLI on your local machine.

         Create an alias in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):
         ```shell
            alias fz='docker run --rm -it -v .:/project fluxzero/cli:latest' 
         ```

      </TabItem> */}

      <TabItem label="Manually">
         If you prefer, you can install the Fluxzero CLI with a few steps yourself
         1. Download the latest [flux-cli.jar](https://github.com/fluxzero-io/fluxzero-cli/releases/latest/download/fluxzero-cli.jar)
         2. Place it in your home directory under `.flux/flux-cli.jar`
         3. Create an alias in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):
            ```shell
            alias fz='java -jar ~/.fluxzero/flux-cli.jar'
            ```

         ❗️ Note that the CLI is only tested on Java 21. We recommend to install `temurin 21` for the best compatibility.
      </TabItem>
         
      
   </Tabs>

   

    

2. Generate a new project

   ```shell
      fz init 
   ```
   This command will prompt you for a few questions to set up your project:

    <img src="/terminal/fz-init-noargs.gif" />

    You can also pass options directly, for example:

   ```shell
      fz init --name my-project 
   ```

   The cli will ask you which template you want to use. See `fz -h` for more options.

3. Build your project

   ```shell
      cd my-project
      ./gradlew build
   ```

</Steps>
