## Recommendations

General recommendations for setting up IntelliJ IDEA for Flux development:
- **Use IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate**: The Community Edition lacks some features that are useful for Flux development, such as advanced Spring Boot support.


## Template project
When starting a project with the Flux CLI, you will automatically get a `.idea` folder in your project root. 
This folder contains the IntelliJ IDEA project configuration files with the necessary settings for Flux development.

Currently, you will find that our configuration contains

- Live templates; when you type 'flux' in a file, IntelliJ IDEA will suggest Flux-specific templates.
- Preventing false-positive findings of "Unused classes"
- A custom run configuration for running your Flux application directly from the IDE.
- Web request example directly usable from IntelliJ IDEA

## Known limitations
- Spring Boot Integration: properties of `@Stateful` may be classified as "no autowire candidate available". This is incorrect, it happens because IDEA is not aware of certain beans.


<Aside type='note'>
We are working on an IntelliJ IDEA plugin for Flux, which will provide additional features and better integration with the IDE.
