# What is Fluxzero?

Fluxzero is a developer productivity platform that simplifies modern backend development. It’s built for teams who want to move fast without getting lost in boilerplate or operational overhead.

> **You focus on your business logic. Fluxzero handles the rest.**

## Our mission

Building software today means stitching together countless tools and frameworks: identity management, APIs, auditing, search, scalability, and security. Most of your time ends up spent on infrastructure—not the product.

**Fluxzero flips that around.**

It gives you a clean, scalable foundation for software development, with everything you need to ship business applications out of the box:

- **Scalable by default** – No setup required to scale across machines, regions or workloads.
- **Secure by default** – Your applications are never exposed directly to the internet.
- **Complete toolkit** – Built-in support for HTTP, job scheduling, full-text search, auditing, and more.
- **Java-based** – Use the libraries, tools, and ecosystem you already know.
- **Open source** – Self-host it or use our fully managed service.


Basically, we want you to focus on building your product, not the infrastructure. Fluxzero is designed to handle the heavy lifting so you can ship features faster and with less hassle.

- Everything is extremely testable without the need for mocking or stubbing
- No dependencies on complicated infrastructure
- For development, you only need Java (no databases, no message brokers, no caching layers)
-

## Who it's for

Fluxzero is designed for developers building internal tools, APIs, or backend systems that need to grow with your business.
 If you're tired of wiring together the same plumbing for every project, Fluxzero gives you a better baseline.

## Fluxzero components

In the diagram below, you can see the main components of a Fluxzero application and how they interact with each other.

- **Centralized orchestration via the Fluxzero Server**  
  The server is the brain of the system: it handles message routing, storage, indexing for search, scheduling, and autoscaling.

- **No direct HTTP exposure**  
  Applications don’t expose HTTP endpoints themselves. All external traffic flows through the **Fluxzero Proxy**, which handles authentication, rate limiting, and routing.

- **External HTTP integration via proxy**  
  Outgoing calls to third-party APIs also pass through the proxy.  
  [Why this is a good idea →](../concepts/proxy-routing)


- **Persistent WebSocket connections**  
  Fluxzero clients connect to the server via WebSockets, enabling real-time bi-directional communication at scale.


## Message driven

Fluxzero takes a different approach to backend development. Everything in a Fluxzero application is message driven. 

**Message-driven by design**  
Fluxzero applications communicate using typed messages:  
- **Commands** trigger behavior  
- **Queries** fetch data  
- **Events** represent facts that happened




## Server requirements 

- Java 21 or higher
- PostgreSQL 15 or higher
