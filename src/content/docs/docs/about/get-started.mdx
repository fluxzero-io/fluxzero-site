## Scaffold a new project

To build Fluxzero projects, the only thing you need is Java 21+. However, we recommend using the **Fluxzero CLI** as provides a lot of convenience features to help you get started quickly. The CLI is a command line tool that helps you scaffold, build, and run Fluxzero applications.

<Steps>

1. Get the Fluxzero CLI

   <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Bash">
         ```shell
            curl -o- -s -L https://github.com/flux-capacitor-io/flux-cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
         ```

         This script will perform the following actions
         - Check if you have Java 21+ installed
         - Download the latest Fluxzero CLI release 
         - Install the CLI in `~/.flux/cli`
         - (Optionally) Install Fluxzero command `fz` into `/usr/local/bin`
      </TabItem>

      <TabItem label="Docker">
         If you prefer to use Docker, you can run the Fluxzero CLI in a container. This is useful if you don't want to install Java or the CLI on your local machine.

         Create an alias in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):
         ```shell
            alias fz='docker run --rm -it -v .:/project flux-zero/cli:latest' 
         ```

      </TabItem>

      <TabItem label="Manually">
         If you prefer, you can install the Fluxzero CLI with a few steps yourself
         1. Download the latest [flux-cli.jar](https://github.com/flux-capacitor-io/flux-cli/releases/latest/download/flux-cli.jar)
         2. Place it in your home directory under `.flux/flux-cli.jar`
         3. Create an alias in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):
            ```shell
            alias fz='java -jar ~/.flux/flux-cli.jar'
            ```
      </TabItem>
         
      
   </Tabs>

   

    

2. Generate a new project

   ```shell
      fz init 
   ```
   This command will prompt you for a few questions to set up your project. You can also pass options directly, for example:

   ```shell
      fz init --name my-project 
   ```

   The cli will ask you which template you want to use. See `fz -h` for more options.

3. Build your project

   ```shell
      cd my-project
      ./gradlew build
   ```
