> **FluxHome** is a smart home system built with **Fluxzero**. Throughout the documentation, you’ll build and extend it to learn how to write message-driven business logic using Fluxzero's primitives.

## What is Fluxzero?

Fluxzero helps you build applications where business logic is driven by messages—**commands, events, and queries**—instead of tightly coupled service calls or stateful components.

You focus on what your system should *do*, and Fluxzero handles:
- Routing and dispatching messages
- Persisting and replaying state
- Handling side effects
- Keeping your application responsive and consistent

There’s no boilerplate, no orchestration layer to manage, and no infrastructure code to write.

## What will we build?

To show how Fluxzero works in practice, we’ll build **FluxHome**: a smart home system made up of rooms, devices, sensors, and automations.

You’ll start simple:
- Turn on a light in a room using a command
- Record and react to motion detection
- Track the state of each device in the home

Then gradually build out more advanced features:
- Automate behavior based on time, rules, or context
- Model smart thermostats and door locks
- Notify users of important events
- Add real-time dashboards and projections

Each feature will demonstrate a specific Fluxzero concept—clearly, incrementally, and with real code.

## Why this approach?

Most applications are eventful by nature: users do things, systems respond, and state evolves over time.

Fluxzero helps you structure those systems around **messages and reactions**, not request chains or shared state. FluxHome gives us a familiar, extensible environment to explore that style of development.

> ✨ You’ll write business logic the way it was meant to be written: declarative, testable, and focused on behavior—not plumbing.
