Fluxzero offers built-in support for handling sensitive information with care using the `@ProtectData` and
`@DropProtectedData` annotations.

These tools help prevent sensitive fields (e.g., passwords, SSNs, tokens) from being unnecessarily stored, logged, or
retained — supporting compliance with data protection standards like **GDPR** and **ISO 27001**.

## @ProtectData: mark sensitive fields

To prevent a field from being stored with the rest of a message payload, annotate it with `@ProtectData`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    public record RegisterCitizen(String name,
                                  @ProtectData String socialSecurityNumber) {
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    data class RegisterCitizen(
        val name: String,
        @ProtectData val socialSecurityNumber: String
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When this message is dispatched, the `socialSecurityNumber` will be:

- **Offloaded** to a separate data vault
- **Redacted** from the main payload (not visible in logs or message inspectors)
- **Re-injected** automatically when the message is handled

This happens transparently — you can access the field as usual in handler methods.

---

## @DropProtectedData: remove when done

If the protected data should only be retained **temporarily**, annotate the handler method with `@DropProtectedData`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    @HandleCommand
    @DropProtectedData
    void handle(RegisterCitizen command) {
        validate(command.getSocialSecurityNumber());
        ...
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    @HandleCommand
    @DropProtectedData
    fun handle(command: RegisterCitizen) {
        validate(command.socialSecurityNumber)
        ...
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once this handler completes:

- The injected `socialSecurityNumber` is permanently deleted from storage.
- Future replays will deserialize the message with that field omitted.

<Aside type="caution">
This mechanism ensures sensitive fields are usable just-in-time and discarded thereafter.
</Aside>

## Use cases

- Temporary use of sensitive tokens or credentials
- Compliance with **data minimization** and **retention policies**
- Preventing accidental exposure in logs or audits

---

## Replays and protected data

During replays, if a message with protected fields is re-invoked **after** data has been dropped, those fields will be
missing or set to `null`.

<Aside type="note">
Design your handlers to tolerate this by making such fields optional or guarding usage.
</Aside>

## Notes

- Only **fields** can be annotated with `@ProtectData` (not method parameters).
- Dropping data is **irreversible**. Make sure all processing is complete before it is removed.
- Support for nested structures is currently limited — annotate each sensitive field explicitly.
