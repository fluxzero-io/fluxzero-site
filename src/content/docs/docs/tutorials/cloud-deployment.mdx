# Fluxzero Cloud

Fluxzero Cloud is a fully managed hosting and observability platform for Fluxzero applications. It handles infrastructure, deployment, monitoring, scaling, and logs—so you can stay focused on writing clean business logic.

> ⚠️ Fluxzero Cloud is currently in private beta. [Request access](/contact) if you’d like to be part of the early adopters.

## Why Fluxzero Cloud?

Fluxzero’s primary goal is to make backend development radically simpler and more productive.

The SDK helps you build clean, observable applications. But writing the code is only part of the story—deploying, running, and monitoring your app is just as important.

Fluxzero Cloud gives you:

- GitHub-based deployments (or deploy via API)
- Full audit trail of all incoming and outgoing messages
- Automatic scaling and zero-downtime deployments
- Real-time insights into usage and performance
- Live inspection of application state
- Managed clusters, backups, secrets, and tenant routing

---

## Deploying from GitHub

To deploy your app, all you need is a GitHub Actions workflow and your Fluxzero API key.

Here’s an example:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Generate Fluxzero JWT
    id: jwt
    uses: fluxzero-io/fluxzero-jwt-action@v1
    with:
      api-key: ${{ secrets.FLUXZERO_API_KEY }}

  # Build and push your docker image...

  - name: Deploy app to Fluxzero Cloud
    uses: fluxzero-io/fluxzero-deploy-action@v1
    with:
      cluster-name: "Production"
      application-name: "To Do"
      image-name: ${{ env.image_name }}
      version: ${{ env.image_version }}
      token: ${{ steps.jwt.outputs.token }}
```

<Aside type="note">
    You can also deploy via API using your generated JWT token.

## Dashboard Preview

Below is a snapshot of the Fluxzero Cloud dashboard, showing running applications in a production cluster.

The dashboard already supports:

- ✅ Organization & cluster management
- ✅ App deployments and versioning
- ✅ Secrets and environment variables
- ✅ Logs, schedules, and web request inspection
- ✅ Usage monitoring and task breakdowns
- ✅ Multi-tenant routing and domain config
- ✅ User access control and invoicing
- ✅ Data backups and restores

## What’s Coming Next

While many features are already live in the private beta, here’s a quick look at what’s on the way:

- Configure endpoints, routing, and tenants directly from the dashboard
- Roll back deployments with a single click
- Auto-scale trackers and applications
- Common admin queries and commands
