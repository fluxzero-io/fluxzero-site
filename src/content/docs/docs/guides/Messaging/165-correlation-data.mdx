Every message in Fluxzero includes correlation metadata that enables traceability across applications, clients, and handlers.
This correlation data is automatically added by the Fluxzero SDK to the `Metadata` of published messages.

---

| Metadata key | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **$applicationId** | Unique identifier of the Fluxzero application instance that produced the message. |
| **$clientId** | Identifier of the client (SDK instance) within the application. |
| **$clientName** | Human-readable name of the client, typically derived from configuration or environment. |
| **$consumer** | Name of the consumer that handled or tracked the message. |
| **$tracker** | Identifier of the tracker that processed the message batch. |
| **$correlationId** | Unique correlation ID shared by all messages related to the same logical operation. |
| **$traceId** | Identifier used for distributed tracing across services and applications. |
| **$trigger** | Identifies the triggering message or context that caused this message to be published. |
| **$triggerType** | The type of the triggering message or context (e.g., command, event, schedule). |
| **$invocation** | Identifier for a specific invocation or execution path, useful for replay and debugging. |
| **$msDelay** | The delay (in milliseconds) applied before a scheduled message was executed. |

<Aside>
Flux reserves `$` as a prefix for metadata property names.
You are allowed to use the `$` prefix for your own metadata properties, but this is unsupported and therefore we recommend to use a different prefix to avoid conflicts with Fluxzero's internal metadata properties.

See <Jdoclink className="CorrelationDataProvider" /> for the full list of metadata properties that are propagated by default.

<Aside type="tip">
Correlation metadata makes it easy to trace messages end-to-end across multiple services, handlers, and time windows.
