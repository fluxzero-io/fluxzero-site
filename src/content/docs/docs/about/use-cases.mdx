## Where does Fluxzero shine?

Fluxzero is very versatile and excels in almost any software domain. Here are some common use cases where Fluxzero's architecture and features provide significant advantages:

- **Rapid development**: Fluxzero's opinionated structure and built-in features allow you to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure, speeding up development time.
- **Scalable applications**: Fluxzero is designed to scale out of the box, making it ideal for applications that need to handle high loads or large datasets.
- **Complex business logic**: If your application has intricate business rules, Fluxzero's message-driven architecture helps you manage complexity by separating concerns and keeping your code clean.
- **Auditing and observability**: With built-in support for auditing and observability, Fluxzero is a great choice for applications that require detailed tracking of user actions and system events.

Fluxzero can be used to build an MVP or power a microservice architecture of 100s of services where complex business logic, scalability, and observability are critical. [Check out some use cases](/customers).
