## Scaffold a new project

To build Flux projects, the only thing you need is Java 21+. However, we recommend using the **Flux CLI** as provides a lot of convenience features to help you get started quickly. The CLI is a command line tool that helps you scaffold, build, and run Flux applications.

<Steps>

1. Install the Flux CLI

   ```shell
      curl -o- -s -L https://github.com/flux-capacitor-io/flux-cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
   ```

   This script will perform the following actions
    - Check if you have Java 21+ installed
    - Download the latest Flux CLI release 
    - Install the CLI in `~/.flux/cli`
    - Create an alias `fz` for `~/.flux/cli` 

    If you prefer, you can perform the steps yourself. However, make sure to install the jar in your home directory under `.flux/cli` if you want the auto update support to work.


2. Generate a new project

   ```shell
      fz init 
   ```
   This command will prompt you for a few questions to set up your project. You can also pass options directly, for example:

   ```shell
      fz init --name my-project 
   ```

   See `fz -h` for more options.

3. Build your project

   ```shell
      cd my-project
      ./gradlew build
   ```
